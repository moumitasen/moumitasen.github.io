	<ul style="margin:20px">
		<li>Chitchat wants to be as flexible as possible to accomodate its students' busy schedule. But in order to maintain smooth-functioning of all our classes, we have to follow some strict guidelines. </li>

		<li>We allow a class to be rescheduled a maximum of two times. If you do not take the class after the second rescheduling, it will be treated as no-show and Chitchat will not be able to refund the amount.  </li>

		<li>In case of change of class time desired by the student, the student must inform Chitchat at least 24 hours before the scheduled class. Otherwise, Chitchat will not be able to reschedule the class or refund the amount paid for the class. </li>

		<li> In case of change of time desired by the teacher, the teacher or Chitchat will inform the student at least 24 hours before the scheduled class. In the event of failure to do so, Chitchat will reschedule the class or refund the entire amount paid for the class (if so desired by the student). </li>

	</ul>

	<h3 style="margin:10px">Payments</h3>
	<ul style="margin:20px">

		<li> No refunds will be made if a student does not show up for a scheduled class. If the student desires to change the class timing, it has to be done 24 hours before the scheduled time or else it will be treated as a no-show and no refunds will be made by Chitchat.</li>
